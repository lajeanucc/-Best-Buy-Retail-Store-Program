POINT OF SALE (POS) SYSTEM - Best Buy Retail Store
====================================================================

PROGRAM PURPOSE:
---------------
This Python program simulates a basic Point of Sale (POS) system for a retail store.
It allows a cashier to:
    - View a list of available products.
    - Add and remove items from a customer's shopping cart.
    - View the cart at any time.
    - Calculate subtotal, apply tax and discounts.
    - Accept customer payment.
    - Generate and print a formatted receipt.
    - Handle multiple transactions in one session.
    - Alert if any product is running low on stock (less than 5 units).

HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM:

1. Make sure Python is installed on your computer (Python 3.x recommended).
2. Save this file as:
   Mesquita.Bentley-POS_Program-ITT103-SP2025.py
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the folder where the file is saved.
